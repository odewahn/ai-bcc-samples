Here is the table of contents for a book called {{title}}:

{{block}}

First, create a section labelled "# Notes on the Table of Contents". Then write a summary that condenses each main heading into a paragraph based on the subheadings. This should sound as much like a narrative as possible.

Then, create a new section header that begins with "# Key Takeaways from the Table of contents". Read back through this summary notes you just created and pick out 5 to 7 bullet points that reflects the key topics covered in the book that a reader would find most useful. Each point should cover the main idea of the section it represents and why it matters.
